# TradeScout Gap Trading Strategy Guide

**Strategy:** After-Hours/Pre-Market Analysis → Market Open Trading  
**Focus:** High-Probability Gap Continuation Trades  
**Risk Level:** Medium to High (with proper risk management)  
**Typical Hold Time:** 30 minutes to 2 hours  
**Target Audience:** Personal trading with systematic approach

---

## Executive Summary

**Phase 1 Focus:** Systematic gap candidate identification using academic research and practitioner insights. The goal is to separate high-probability opportunities from market noise before any trading decisions.

**Core Principle:** 80% of gaps are noise (common gaps), 20% are tradeable opportunities. Our job is to identify that 20% and avoid the other 80%.

**Research Foundation:** Based on 90-year academic study showing only 20% of gaps fill within 5 days, contradicting popular trading wisdom. Focus on momentum continuation rather than gap fills.

---

## Phase 1: Gap Candidate Identification

### ✅ GOOD CANDIDATES (Trade Opportunities)

#### **Breakaway Gaps - Trend Initiation (70% continuation rate)**
**Identification Criteria:**
- Gap size: 2-5% from consolidation/range break
- Volume: 2x+ average daily volume
- Context: Breaking key resistance/support levels
- Pattern: Emerges from sideways consolidation (5+ days)

**Why These Work:**
- New information changes fundamental value perception
- Institutional money enters at breakout levels
- Technical traders follow momentum signals
- Self-reinforcing psychology drives continuation

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Strong continuation probability but needs volume confirmation

#### **Continuation Gaps - Trend Acceleration (80% continuation rate)**
**Identification Criteria:**
- Gap size: 2-7% within established trend
- Context: Occurs mid-trend (not at beginning/end)
- Trend age: At least 10 trading days of clear direction
- Volume: 1.5x+ average (confirms institutional participation)

**Why These Work:**
- Momentum accelerates existing institutional flows
- FOMO effect brings in new participants
- Technical resistance levels get overwhelmed
- Algorithmic systems amplify the move

**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM - Highest probability setups when properly identified

#### **News-Catalyst Gaps - Event-Driven (Variable 60-90% based on catalyst)**
**Identification Criteria:**
- Gap size: 3%+ with fundamental news
- Catalyst quality: FDA approvals (90%), earnings beats (70%), mergers (85%)
- Volume surge: 3x+ normal volume in pre-market
- News source: Professional financial media coverage

**Why These Work:**
- Real business value changes justify price movement
- Institutional algorithms react immediately to data
- Sustained buying/selling pressure throughout day
- Binary events create clear directional bias

**Risk Level:** LOW-HIGH (depends on catalyst quality)

### ❌ BAD CANDIDATES (Avoid These)

#### **Common Gaps - Market Noise (25% continuation rate)**
**Identification Criteria:**
- Gap size: <1.5% price movement
- Volume: Normal or below-normal trading activity
- Context: No clear fundamental catalyst
- Pattern: Random occurrence within trading range

**Why These Fail:**
- Statistical noise, not meaningful price discovery
- Easy to reverse with normal market activity
- No sustained institutional interest
- Academic research shows 75% failure rate

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Low probability, high transaction costs

#### **Exhaustion Gaps - Trend Ending (20% continuation rate)**
**Identification Criteria:**
- Gap size: 5%+ at end of extended move
- Volume: Extreme (3x-10x normal) - climax volume
- Context: After 20+ day trend with recent acceleration
- Sentiment: Euphoria/panic extremes (VIX spikes)

**Why These Fail:**
- Mark the END of trends, not continuation
- Extreme volume indicates selling climax
- Contrarian opportunity, not momentum play
- High reversal probability within days

**Risk Level:** VERY HIGH - Counter-trend signals, expect reversals

#### **Thin Volume Gaps - Manipulation Risk (15% continuation rate)**
**Identification Criteria:**
- Large % gap but <50% normal volume
- After-hours trading on minimal shares
- Small float stocks (<100M shares)
- Wide bid-ask spreads (>1%)

**Why These Fail:**
- Easily manipulated by small orders
- Real volume at open often reverses direction
- Liquidity issues make execution difficult
- Often retail emotion, not institutional flow

**Risk Level:** EXTREME - Avoid entirely

#### **Counter-Trend Gaps - Fighting the Market (30% continuation rate)**
**Identification Criteria:**
- Stock gaps opposite to market direction
- Individual stock up while sector down
- Goes against economic narrative
- Opposes major technical levels

**Why These Fail:**
- Swimming upstream exhausts momentum quickly
- Market makers arbitrage the difference
- Institutional flows usually overwhelm stock-specific news
- Higher probability of reversal to mean

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Market typically wins individual battles

---

## Phase 2: Sentiment Analysis (Future Development)

**TODO:** Further assessment of Phase 1 candidates through sentiment analysis layer:
- Social media sentiment scoring (Reddit, Twitter, Discord)
- Options flow analysis (unusual activity, put/call ratios)
- Institutional vs retail participation indicators
- News sentiment analysis and catalyst quality scoring
- Market regime assessment (bull/bear/sideways context)

This second pass will refine our candidate list from "tradeable" to "high-probability tradeable" before any position sizing or entry decisions.

## Phase 3: Daily Gap Report Generation (Future Development)

**TODO:** Automated daily morning report combining Phase 1 + Phase 2 analysis:
- Pre-market gap candidates with risk assessments
- Sentiment scores and catalyst quality ratings
- Market regime context and sector alignment
- Position sizing recommendations based on risk levels
- Priority rankings for highest-probability setups
- Automated delivery via email/dashboard at 6:00 AM

This comprehensive report will provide a systematic daily workflow for gap trading decisions, eliminating emotional decision-making and ensuring consistent application of our research-based criteria.

## Risk Management Framework

### Position Sizing Rules
**Conservative Approach (Recommended):**
- Maximum 2% of portfolio per trade
- Reduce to 1% for gaps <2%
- Increase to 3% only for highest conviction setups (news + volume + sector momentum)
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose on any single trade

**Account Size Guidelines:**
- <$25K account: Maximum $500 per trade
- $25K-$100K account: Maximum $2,000 per trade  
- >$100K account: Maximum 2% of account value

### Stop-Loss Strategy
**Tight Stops Are Essential:**
- Set stop-loss immediately upon entry
- Maximum 2% loss from entry point
- Consider 1% stop for smaller accounts
- Never move stops against you ("hoping it comes back")

**Stop Placement Techniques:**
- Below/above the gap fill level
- At pre-market low/high
- At previous day's close (gap fill)
- At nearest technical support/resistance

### Time-Based Exits
**The Clock Is Your Friend:**
- Plan to exit within first 2 hours if no progress
- Many gaps show their true direction in first 30 minutes
- Avoid holding through lunch (11:30 AM - 1:30 PM) when volume dies
- Consider taking partial profits after 30-60 minutes

### Take Profit Strategy
**Scale Out Approach:**
- Take 50% profits at 1:1 risk/reward ratio
- Let remaining 50% run to 2:1 or 3:1
- Don't get greedy - quick profits compound
- Better to leave money on the table than give back gains

---

## Quality Scoring System

### High-Probability Setup (Score 80+)
**Required Elements:**
- Gap >2% with clear news catalyst (40 points)
- Pre-market volume >3x average (25 points)
- Sector momentum alignment (15 points)
- Market direction alignment (15 points)
- Large cap stock (>$5B market cap) (10 points)

**Action:** Strong buy/short candidate with full position size

### Medium-Probability Setup (Score 60-79)
**Characteristics:**
- Missing 1-2 key elements from high-probability
- May have smaller gap but strong volume
- Or large gap but weaker catalyst
- Some uncertainty but still tradeable

**Action:** Reduced position size (1% vs 2%), tighter stops

### Low-Probability Setup (Score <60)
**Characteristics:**
- Missing multiple key elements
- Contradictory signals
- Thin volume or small gaps
- Counter-trend movement

**Action:** Avoid or paper trade only for learning

## Market Timing Considerations

### Best Trading Windows
**First 30 Minutes (9:30-10:00 AM):**
- Highest volume and volatility
- True direction often revealed
- Best entry and exit liquidity
- Most institutional activity

**Avoid These Times:**
- 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM (lunch lull)
- Last 10 minutes of day (unpredictable)
- First 5 minutes (too chaotic)
- During major economic announcements

### Market Condition Adjustments
**Bull Market:**
- Focus more on long gaps
- Higher success rate for upward gaps
- Can afford slightly larger position sizes
- Market provides tailwind

**Bear Market:**
- Focus more on short gaps
- Be more selective with long positions
- Reduce overall position sizes
- Quicker profit-taking recommended

**Sideways/Choppy Market:**
- Most challenging environment
- Reduce position sizes significantly
- Focus only on highest-conviction setups
- Consider stepping aside entirely
