# TradeScout Gap Trading Strategy Guide

**Strategy:** After-Hours/Pre-Market Analysis → Market Open Trading  
**Focus:** High-Probability Gap Continuation Trades  
**Risk Level:** Medium to High (with proper risk management)  
**Typical Hold Time:** 30 minutes to 2 hours  
**Target Audience:** Personal trading with systematic approach

---

## Executive Summary

Gap trading based on after-hours and pre-market analysis can be profitable when executed with proper screening criteria and risk management. The key is not to trade every gap, but to systematically identify the highest-probability setups while avoiding the common pitfalls that trap retail traders.

**Core Principle:** Quality over quantity - trade fewer, better setups rather than chasing every gap.

## What Actually Works: The High-Probability Setups

### 1. Large News-Driven Gaps
**Characteristics:**
- Gap size >2% (preferably >3%)
- Clear fundamental catalyst (earnings, FDA approval, merger news, etc.)
- High pre-market volume (3x+ normal volume)
- Professional news sources reporting the story

**Why It Works:**
- Real information creates sustained buying/selling pressure
- Institutional money flows in the same direction
- Retail traders pile on throughout the day
- News creates psychological momentum

**Examples of Strong Catalysts:**
- Earnings beats/misses with guidance changes
- FDA drug approvals or trial results
- Merger & acquisition announcements
- Major contract wins or partnership deals
- Regulatory approvals or rejections

### 2. Sector Momentum Plays
**Characteristics:**
- Multiple stocks in same sector gapping in same direction
- Sector-specific news or trend driving movement
- Leadership stocks (market cap >$5B) participating
- Broad market supporting the direction

**Why It Works:**
- Rising tide lifts all boats effect
- Algorithmic trading amplifies sector moves
- Fund managers rotate money between sectors
- Easier to ride a wave than fight the current

**Strong Sector Signals:**
- 5+ stocks in sector gapping >1% same direction
- Sector ETF (XLK, XLF, XLE) gapping significantly
- Industry-specific news affecting multiple companies
- Government policy changes impacting entire sectors

### 3. Market-Aligned Momentum
**Characteristics:**
- Stock gap aligns with overall market direction
- Major indices (SPY, QQQ, IWM) supporting the move
- Economic data or Fed news driving broad sentiment
- International markets providing tailwind

**Why It Works:**
- Fighting the market trend is usually futile
- Broad market moves create sustained pressure
- Algorithmic trading amplifies index movements
- Easier execution when market makers are aligned

---

## What Doesn't Work: The Trap Setups

### 1. Small, Technical Gaps
**Characteristics:**
- Gap size <1%
- No clear fundamental reason
- Normal or below-normal volume
- Random price movement

**Why It Fails:**
- Usually just market noise
- Easily reversed by normal trading activity
- No sustained buying/selling pressure
- High probability of gap fill

### 2. Thin Volume Gaps
**Characteristics:**
- Large percentage gap but low absolute volume
- After-hours trading on minimal shares
- Wide bid-ask spreads
- Small float or illiquid stocks

**Why It Fails:**
- Easy to manipulate with small orders
- Real volume at market open often reverses the gap
- Liquidity issues make exit difficult
- Often represents retail emotion, not institutional flow

### 3. Counter-Trend Gaps
**Characteristics:**
- Stock gaps up while market gaps down (or vice versa)
- Goes against prevailing sector trend
- Fights major technical levels
- Opposes broader economic narrative

**Why It Fails:**
- Swimming upstream is exhausting
- Market makers will arbitrage the difference
- Institutional flows usually overwhelm individual stock news
- Higher probability of reversal

### 4. Friday Gaps
**Characteristics:**
- Gaps occurring on Friday morning
- Weekend risk uncertainty
- Lower institutional participation
- Reduced volume due to early weekend departures

**Why It Fails:**
- Weekend news risk creates uncertainty
- Reduced institutional participation
- Profit-taking before weekend
- Lower volume makes moves less reliable

## Risk Management Framework

### Position Sizing Rules
**Conservative Approach (Recommended):**
- Maximum 2% of portfolio per trade
- Reduce to 1% for gaps <2%
- Increase to 3% only for highest conviction setups (news + volume + sector momentum)
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose on any single trade

**Account Size Guidelines:**
- <$25K account: Maximum $500 per trade
- $25K-$100K account: Maximum $2,000 per trade  
- >$100K account: Maximum 2% of account value

### Stop-Loss Strategy
**Tight Stops Are Essential:**
- Set stop-loss immediately upon entry
- Maximum 2% loss from entry point
- Consider 1% stop for smaller accounts
- Never move stops against you ("hoping it comes back")

**Stop Placement Techniques:**
- Below/above the gap fill level
- At pre-market low/high
- At previous day's close (gap fill)
- At nearest technical support/resistance

### Time-Based Exits
**The Clock Is Your Friend:**
- Plan to exit within first 2 hours if no progress
- Many gaps show their true direction in first 30 minutes
- Avoid holding through lunch (11:30 AM - 1:30 PM) when volume dies
- Consider taking partial profits after 30-60 minutes

### Take Profit Strategy
**Scale Out Approach:**
- Take 50% profits at 1:1 risk/reward ratio
- Let remaining 50% run to 2:1 or 3:1
- Don't get greedy - quick profits compound
- Better to leave money on the table than give back gains

## Quality Scoring System

### High-Probability Setup (Score 80+)
**Required Elements:**
- Gap >2% with clear news catalyst (40 points)
- Pre-market volume >3x average (25 points)
- Sector momentum alignment (15 points)
- Market direction alignment (15 points)
- Large cap stock (>$5B market cap) (10 points)

**Action:** Strong buy/short candidate with full position size

### Medium-Probability Setup (Score 60-79)
**Characteristics:**
- Missing 1-2 key elements from high-probability
- May have smaller gap but strong volume
- Or large gap but weaker catalyst
- Some uncertainty but still tradeable

**Action:** Reduced position size (1% vs 2%), tighter stops

### Low-Probability Setup (Score <60)
**Characteristics:**
- Missing multiple key elements
- Contradictory signals
- Thin volume or small gaps
- Counter-trend movement

**Action:** Avoid or paper trade only for learning

## Market Timing Considerations

### Best Trading Windows
**First 30 Minutes (9:30-10:00 AM):**
- Highest volume and volatility
- True direction often revealed
- Best entry and exit liquidity
- Most institutional activity

**Avoid These Times:**
- 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM (lunch lull)
- Last 10 minutes of day (unpredictable)
- First 5 minutes (too chaotic)
- During major economic announcements

### Market Condition Adjustments
**Bull Market:**
- Focus more on long gaps
- Higher success rate for upward gaps
- Can afford slightly larger position sizes
- Market provides tailwind

**Bear Market:**
- Focus more on short gaps
- Be more selective with long positions
- Reduce overall position sizes
- Quicker profit-taking recommended

**Sideways/Choppy Market:**
- Most challenging environment
- Reduce position sizes significantly
- Focus only on highest-conviction setups
- Consider stepping aside entirely

- Chasing gaps that have already moved significantly
- Entering without proper setup confirmation
- Ignoring risk management rules when "sure thing" appears

**Revenge Trading:**
- Doubling down after a loss
- Abandoning strategy after bad trade
- Taking excessive risk to "get even"

**Overconfidence:**
- Increasing position sizes after wins

- Trading every gap instead of waiting for quality

### Technical Mistakes

- **Daily Commitment**: Requires consistent 6 AM analysis and 9:30 AM execution discipline
- **News Timing Risk**: Weekend gaps (Friday trades) create additional uncertainty

**Execution Challenges:**

- **Timing Pressure**: Requires split-second decisions in volatile first 30 minutes
- **Liquidity Concerns**: Some gapping stocks may have temporary liquidity issues

**Portfolio Concentration:**
- **Single Strategy Risk**: No hedging or market-neutral components for diversification
- **Momentum Bias**: Concentrated in directional, news-driven plays
- **Correlation Risk**: Gap trades often move together during market stress
