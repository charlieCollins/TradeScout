## Project Setup & Architecture (July 20, 2025)

### âœ… What Worked Well

#### Interface-First Design Decision
- **Decision**: Design all interfaces and data models before implementing any external API integrations
- **Outcome**: Created clean abstractions that prevent vendor lock-in
- **Lesson**: Starting with interfaces forces you to think about the problem domain rather than API limitations
- **Future Application**: Always design your internal model first, then adapt external sources to fit

#### Documentation-Driven Development
- **Decision**: Move all detailed docs to `/docs` and keep README.md concise
- **Outcome**: Clean project structure that's easy to navigate
- **Lesson**: Developers want quick start info, detailed docs should be discoverable but not overwhelming
- **Future Application**: README = quick start, `/docs` = comprehensive reference

#### WSL + IntelliJ IDEA Development Setup
- **Decision**: Use WSL for Linux compatibility with IntelliJ IDEA on Windows for editing
- **Outcome**: Best of both worlds - Linux tools with powerful IDE
- **Lesson**: Modern development benefits from hybrid approaches
- **Future Application**: Don't be dogmatic about single-platform solutions

### ðŸ”„ What We'd Do Differently

#### Environment File Location
- **Original Approach**: Put `.env` in `/config` directory
- **Better Approach**: Move `.env` to project root (industry standard)
- **Lesson**: Follow established conventions even if your structure might seem more logical
- **Why This Matters**: Tooling and team expectations align with standards

#### Requirements Organization
- **Current**: Single `requirements.txt` with everything
- **Future Improvement**: Consider `requirements/` directory with:
  - `base.txt` (core dependencies)
  - `dev.txt` (development tools)
  - `prod.txt` (production-only)
- **Lesson**: As projects grow, dependency management becomes critical
- **Not Changed Yet**: Keeping simple for MVP phase

### ðŸ§  Key Insights

#### Data Model Complexity vs. Flexibility Trade-off
- **Insight**: Rich data models (like our `MarketQuote` with calculated fields) provide convenience but increase complexity
- **Decision**: Keep calculated fields for common operations (price_change, gap detection)
- **Rationale**: Trading analysis needs these calculations constantly
- **Monitoring**: Watch for performance impact as data volume grows

#### Rate Limiting as First-Class Concern
- **Insight**: Free APIs have strict rate limits that must be designed around, not retrofitted
- **Decision**: Built `RateLimiter` class into core interfaces from day one
- **Lesson**: Non-functional requirements (rate limits, caching) should be architectural concerns
- **Future Application**: Always consider operational constraints during design

#### Configuration Strategy for Multi-Environment
- **Insight**: Local development, testing, and future cloud deployment need different configurations
- **Decision**: Separate config files with clear inheritance hierarchy
- **Lesson**: Think about the deployment pipeline even in early development
- **Benefit**: Smooth cloud migration path already planned

#### Design Patterns as Architectural Foundation
- **Insight**: Choosing the right design patterns early prevents major refactoring later
- **Decision**: Explicitly consider patterns (Strategy, Adapter, Factory, etc.) for each component
- **Lesson**: Design patterns aren't academic exercises - they solve real maintainability problems
- **Examples in Our Code**:
  - **Adapter Pattern**: External APIs â†’ Internal models (prevents vendor lock-in)
  - **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction (enables database migration)
  - **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple momentum detection algorithms (easy A/B testing)
  - **Factory Pattern**: Provider creation based on config (runtime flexibility)
- **Future Application**: Always ask "What pattern fits this problem?" before implementing

#### Domain Modeling vs Data Structure Approach
- **Initial Mistake**: Created "MarketQuote" and "NewsItem" as standalone data structures
- **Problem Identified**: Mixed concerns - data transfer objects acting as domain entities  
- **Better Approach**: Proper domain modeling with Asset, Market, and MarketSegment as core entities
- **Lesson**: Model the real-world domain first, then build data structures that use those entities
- **Key Insight**: Assets belong to Markets, have Market Segments, and all other data (quotes, news, sentiment) should reference these core entities
- **Result**: Much cleaner model that prevents inconsistencies and enables proper relationships
- **Future Application**: Always start with "What are the core business entities?" before designing data structures

#### Factory Pattern Implementation & Separation of Concerns
- **Design Decision**: Move factory methods from domain models to separate `factories.py` module
- **Rationale**: Domain models should focus on entity definition, not object creation
- **Benefits**: 
  - Clean separation between "what" (domain models) and "how to create" (factories)
  - Easier to maintain and extend factory logic
  - Domain models stay focused on business logic
  - Factory classes can have complex creation logic without cluttering domain
- **Pattern Used**: Abstract Factory + Builder patterns for complex entity creation
- **Result**: `AssetFactory.create_apple()` vs cluttering `Asset` class with creation methods
- **Future Application**: Always separate object creation from object definition

#### Model Organization & File Structure
- **Problem**: Had both `models.py` and `domain_models.py` with overlapping/conflicting definitions
- **Solution**: Clear file organization by responsibility:
  - `domain_models_core.py`: Core business entities (Asset, Market, MarketSegment)
  - `analysis_models.py`: Trading analysis models (TradeSuggestion, TechnicalIndicators)
  - `factories.py`: Object creation patterns
- **Benefit**: Each file has single responsibility, easier to find and maintain code
- **Naming Convention**: `*_core.py` for fundamental entities, `*_models.py` for specialized models
- **Future Application**: Organize models by domain responsibility, not just "all models in one file"

#### Example Data Caching Strategy
- **Pattern Established**: Always save fetched example/demo data locally for reuse
- **Location**: `/data/examples/` with descriptive, timestamped filenames
- **Benefits**: 
  - Faster development (no repeated API calls)
  - Consistent testing across sessions
  - Offline capability for examples
  - Version control of example data evolution
- **Implementation**: `nvidia_data_2025-07-20.json` saved with comprehensive market data
- **Lesson**: Example data is valuable for development - don't waste time refetching the same examples
- **Future Application**: Implement fetch-and-cache pattern for all example data requests

### ðŸ“Š Development Process Insights

#### Claude Code + Planning Workflow Effectiveness
- **Process**: Research â†’ Plan â†’ Design Interfaces â†’ Implement
- **Outcome**: No rework needed, clean architecture from start
- **Lesson**: Time spent in planning and interface design pays huge dividends
- **Counter-intuitive**: Felt slow initially but prevented multiple refactoring cycles

#### Documentation as Design Tool
- **Process**: Writing `ARCHITECTURE.md` revealed interface gaps and design issues
- **Outcome**: Fixed several interface inconsistencies before any implementation
- **Lesson**: Documentation is not just communication, it's a design validation tool
- **Future Application**: Use documentation writing to find design flaws early

### ðŸ”§ Technical Decisions

#### Decimal vs Float for Financial Data
- **Decision**: Use `Decimal` for all price and monetary calculations
- **Rationale**: Avoid floating-point precision errors in financial calculations
- **Lesson**: Financial applications have zero tolerance for precision errors
- **Implementation Note**: Slight performance cost but worth it for accuracy

#### Dataclasses vs. Traditional Classes
- **Decision**: Use `@dataclass` for data models with `__post_init__` for calculated fields
- **Outcome**: Clean, readable models with automatic equality and repr methods
- **Lesson**: Modern Python features significantly reduce boilerplate
- **Future Consideration**: Watch for performance with large datasets

#### SQLite â†’ PostgreSQL Migration Path
- **Decision**: Start with SQLite but design schema for PostgreSQL compatibility
- **Rationale**: Local development simplicity with cloud migration capability
- **Lesson**: Database migration is easier when planned from the beginning
- **Implementation**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM to abstract database differences
