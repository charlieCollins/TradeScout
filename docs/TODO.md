## 🎯 Current Status: **Architecture & Design Complete**

**Last Updated**: July 20, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - MVP Foundation  
**Next Session Priority**: Begin implementing core data collection adapters

### Documentation & Model Reorganization (July 20, 2025)
- [x] **Plan refinement** - Streamlined original 1400+ line plan into concise 400-line TRADE_SCOUT_PLAN.md
- [x] **Documentation cleanup** - Moved all docs to /docs directory, updated references
- [x] **Lessons learned tracking** - Added LESSONS_LEARNED.md for development insights
- [x] **Domain model redesign** - Proper Asset, Market, MarketSegment entities instead of loose data structures
- [x] **Model file organization** - Separated into domain_models_core.py (core entities) and analysis_models.py (trading logic)
- [x] **Factory pattern implementation** - Moved creation logic to dedicated factories.py module
- [x] **Import cleanup** - Removed redundant models.py, updated all imports across project

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Project Foundation (July 20, 2025)
- [x] **Project structure created** - Clean directory layout with proper package structure
- [x] **Requirements.txt defined** - All dependencies identified for MVP and future phases
- [x] **Configuration system** - Environment variables, local config, API key management
- [x] **Data models designed** - Complete models for MarketQuote, TradeSuggestion, ActualTrade, etc.
- [x] **Interface architecture** - Abstract interfaces for all major components
- [x] **Documentation structure** - README, ARCHITECTURE.md, original plan in /docs
- [x] **API keys configured** - Polygon.io API key and S3 flat files credentials added
- [x] **Git setup** - .gitignore configured to protect sensitive data
- [x] **Development workflow** - CLAUDE.md guidelines and LESSONS_LEARNED.md tracking

### Architecture Design (July 20, 2025)
- [x] **Data collection interfaces** - MarketDataProvider, NewsProvider, SentimentProvider
- [x] **Analysis interfaces** - MomentumDetector, TechnicalAnalyzer, SuggestionEngine
- [x] **Storage interfaces** - Repository pattern for all data types
- [x] **Rate limiting design** - RateLimiter class for API management
- [x] **Caching strategy** - DataCache interface for performance
- [x] **Transformation layer** - External API → Internal model adapters

## 🔍 Decision Points Needed

### Next Session Decisions
1. **Data collection priority**: Start with YFinance (unlimited) or Polygon (more features)?
   - **Recommendation**: Start with YFinance for basic functionality, add Polygon for enhanced data

2. **Testing approach**: Unit tests first or integration tests?
   - **Recommendation**: Unit tests with mocked interfaces for data adapters

3. **Database schema**: Start simple or build complete schema?
   - **Recommendation**: Start with quotes table, add others as needed
