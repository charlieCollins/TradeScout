## 🔬 Gap Trading Fundamentals

### Market Gap Definition & Types

**Price Gap:** A discontinuity in price action where the opening price of a security differs significantly from the previous session's closing price, creating a visible "gap" on the price chart.

**Gap Classifications:**
```
Common Gap (Noise):     <1% price difference, normal market fluctuation
Breakaway Gap:          1-3% gap with volume, breaks significant resistance/support  
Runaway Gap:           3-5% gap mid-trend, continuation signal
Exhaustion Gap:        5%+ gap at trend end, potential reversal signal
Earnings Gap:          Any % gap post-earnings, catalyst-driven
News Gap:              Any % gap from breaking news, event-driven
```

### Detailed Gap Classification System

**Source Reference:** [Nasdaq.com - Price Gap Trading Deep Dive](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/price-gap-trading-deep-dive-common-breakaway-continuation-blow)

#### 1. Common Gaps (Trading Noise)
**Characteristics:**
- Size: Typically <1.5% price movement
- Volume: Normal or below-normal trading volume
- Context: Occurs within established trading ranges
- Frequency: Most common type of gap (60-70% of all gaps)

**Trading Implications:**
- **High Fill Probability**: 85-95% fill within 1-3 trading days
- **Low Continuation Rate**: Only 20-30% continue in gap direction
- **Strategy**: Best avoided for directional trading, possible mean reversion plays
- **Risk**: Low reward-to-risk ratio, high transaction costs relative to potential gains

#### 2. Breakaway Gaps (Trend Initiation)
**Characteristics:**
- Size: 2-5% price movement from consolidation areas  
- Volume: Significantly above average (2x-5x normal volume)
- Context: Breaks out of trading ranges, support/resistance levels
- Chart Pattern: Often accompanies other technical breakouts

**Trading Implications:**
- **Fill Probability**: 40-60% fill rate (lower than common gaps)
- **Continuation Rate**: 65-75% continue in gap direction with volume
- **Strategy**: Strong directional trade candidates with proper volume confirmation
- **Risk Management**: Set stops just inside the breakout range

**TradeScout Identification Criteria:**
```python
breakaway_gap_criteria = {
    "gap_size": ">= 2.0%",
    "volume_ratio": ">= 2.0x_average",
    "technical_context": "breaks_key_level",
    "consolidation_period": ">= 5_days",
    "catalyst_present": True
}
```

#### 3. Continuation/Runaway Gaps (Trend Acceleration)
**Characteristics:**
- Size: 2-7% price movement within established trends
- Volume: Above average volume but may be less than breakaway gaps
- Context: Occurs mid-trend, accelerates existing momentum
- Timing: Often appears 1/3 to 2/3 through a trend move

**Trading Implications:**
- **Fill Probability**: 25-40% fill rate (lowest among gap types)
- **Continuation Rate**: 75-85% continue strongly in gap direction  
- **Strategy**: High-probability momentum trades with defined trend context
- **Risk Management**: Use trend-based stops, allow more room for volatility

**TradeScout Identification Criteria:**
```python
continuation_gap_criteria = {
    "gap_size": ">= 2.0%",  
    "trend_context": "clear_trend_present",
    "trend_duration": ">= 10_days",
    "volume_confirmation": ">= 1.5x_average",
    "gap_position": "mid_trend"  # Not at beginning or end
}
```

#### 4. Exhaustion/Blow-off Gaps (Trend Termination)
**Characteristics:**
- Size: Often 5%+ price movement (largest gaps)
- Volume: Extremely high volume (3x-10x normal)
- Context: Occurs at end of extended trends
- Sentiment: Often coincides with extreme euphoria or panic

**Trading Implications:**
- **Fill Probability**: 60-80% fill rate within days/weeks (reversal signal)
- **Continuation Rate**: 15-30% continue (lowest continuation rate)
- **Strategy**: Counter-trend trades, reversal opportunities
- **Risk Management**: Quick profits, tight stops, expect high volatility

**TradeScout Identification Criteria:**
```python
exhaustion_gap_criteria = {
    "gap_size": ">= 5.0%",
    "volume_ratio": ">= 3.0x_average", 
    "trend_age": ">= 20_days",
    "prior_acceleration": True,  # Recent trend acceleration
    "sentiment_extreme": True    # VIX spike, news sentiment extreme
}
```

### Gap Psychology & Market Mechanics

**Why Gaps Occur:**
- After-hours news releases when markets are closed
- Earnings announcements outside trading hours
- Economic data releases (GDP, employment, inflation)
- Geopolitical events and market sentiment shifts
- Large institutional order imbalances at market open
- Algorithmic trading responses to overnight information

**Gap Filling Behavior by Type:**
```python
gap_fill_statistics = {
    "common_gaps": {
        "fill_rate": 0.90,
        "avg_days_to_fill": 2.3,
        "continuation_success": 0.25
    },
    "breakaway_gaps": {
        "fill_rate": 0.50,  
        "avg_days_to_fill": 12.1,
        "continuation_success": 0.70
    },
    "continuation_gaps": {
        "fill_rate": 0.35,
        "avg_days_to_fill": 28.4, 
        "continuation_success": 0.80
    },
    "exhaustion_gaps": {
        "fill_rate": 0.70,
        "avg_days_to_fill": 8.7,
        "continuation_success": 0.20
    }
}
```

**Market Structure Impact:**
- **Pre-market Trading**: Limited liquidity can create artificial gaps
- **Institutional Order Flow**: Large orders create supply/demand imbalances
- **Algorithmic Trading**: Systematic responses amplify gap movements
- **Options Expiration**: Pin/unpin effects can create gaps near key levels

## 📊 Empirical Research Findings

### Gap Performance Statistics

**Success Rate by Gap Size:**
```python
gap_performance_data = {
    "small_gaps": {
        "size_range": "0.5% - 1.5%",
        "fill_rate": 0.95,           # 95% fill within 5 days
        "continuation_rate": 0.35,   # 35% continue in gap direction
        "trade_viability": "LOW"     # Too unpredictable
    },
    "medium_gaps": {
        "size_range": "1.5% - 3.5%", 
        "fill_rate": 0.75,           # 75% fill within 10 days
        "continuation_rate": 0.60,   # 60% continue with news catalyst
        "trade_viability": "MODERATE" # Best risk/reward balance
    },
    "large_gaps": {
        "size_range": "3.5% - 7%",
        "fill_rate": 0.50,           # 50% fill within 20 days  
        "continuation_rate": 0.75,   # 75% continue if volume confirmed
        "trade_viability": "HIGH"    # Best for momentum continuation
    },
    "extreme_gaps": {
        "size_range": ">7%",
        "fill_rate": 0.25,           # 25% fill quickly
        "continuation_rate": 0.85,   # 85% continue but volatile
        "trade_viability": "RISKY"   # High reward, high volatility
    }
}
```

### Volume Confirmation Analysis

**Key Volume Metrics:**
- **Pre-market Volume Surge**: 3x+ normal volume indicates institutional interest
- **Opening Volume**: First 15 minutes should maintain 2x+ average volume
- **Volume Decay**: If volume drops <1.5x average by 10 AM, gap likely to fill
- **Volume Profile**: Consistent high volume throughout first hour sustains gaps

**Volume-Based Success Rates:**
```
High Volume Gaps (3x+ avg):     72% continuation success rate
Medium Volume Gaps (1.5-3x):    48% continuation success rate  
Low Volume Gaps (<1.5x):        23% continuation success rate
```

### News Catalyst Impact

**Catalyst Quality Scoring:**
```python
catalyst_impact_scores = {
    "earnings_beats": {
        "score": 9,
        "sustainability": "HIGH",
        "notes": "Fundamental business improvement, institutional rerating"
    },
    "fda_approvals": {

## 🧮 Statistical Models & Backtesting

### Gap Probability Models

**Gap Continuation Probability Formula:**
```python
def gap_continuation_probability(gap_size, volume_ratio, catalyst_score, market_alignment):
    """
    Calculate probability of gap continuation based on multiple factors
    """
    base_prob = min(0.85, max(0.15, gap_size * 0.12))  # Size factor
    volume_multiplier = min(1.4, max(0.6, volume_ratio * 0.3))  # Volume factor  
    catalyst_multiplier = catalyst_score / 10  # News factor
    market_multiplier = 1.2 if market_alignment else 0.8  # Market factor
    
    probability = base_prob * volume_multiplier * catalyst_multiplier * market_multiplier
    return min(0.95, max(0.05, probability))
```

**Position Size Optimization:**
```python
def optimal_position_size(account_size, gap_probability, risk_tolerance=0.02):
    """
    Kelly Criterion adapted for gap trading
    """
    expected_return = gap_probability * 1.5 - (1 - gap_probability) * 1.0  # 1.5:1 R/R
    kelly_fraction = expected_return / 1.0  # Simplified Kelly
    
    # Conservative adjustment (use 25% of Kelly)
    conservative_fraction = kelly_fraction * 0.25
    max_position = account_size * risk_tolerance
    
    return min(max_position, account_size * conservative_fraction)
```
